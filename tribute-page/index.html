      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "I have made mysterious Nature my religion ... When I gaze at a sunset sky and spend hours contemplating
          its marvellous ever-changing beauty, an extraordinary emotion overwhelms me. Nature in all its vastness
          is truthfully reflected in my sincere though feeble soul. Around me are the trees stretching up their
          branches to the skies, the perfumed flowers gladdening the meadow, the gentle grass-carpeted earth,
          ... and my hands unconsciously assume an attitude of adoration."
        </p>
